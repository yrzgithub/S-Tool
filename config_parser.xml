<!-- 
Vulnerability Description:
This vulnerability is identified as an XML External Entity (XXE) Injection, where external entities can be processed by XML parsers, potentially leading to information disclosure or other security issues. 
-->

<!-- 
Vulnerability Fix Recommendation:
Ensure that XML processing is configured safely by disabling external entity processing and DTDs. 
In Java, invoke factory.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true); 
or use equivalent settings in other programming languages to protect against XXE attacks.
