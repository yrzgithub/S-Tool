# Vulnerability Description:
# TLS/SSL Weak Cipher Suites - The server is configured to allow weak cipher suites
# that are susceptible to various attacks, compromising the confidentiality and
# integrity of the data being transmitted.

# Vulnerability Fix Recommendation:
# Update the server to the latest version and apply security patches regularly.
# Restrict the server to use only secure cipher suites by disabling weak ones.
# Also, implement certificate pinning in your application to prevent 
# man-in-the-middle attacks.
